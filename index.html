    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <body>
        <p>I have studied Economics and was born into a tourism-based working family environment. My professional journey began at the age of 12, when I started working in my family-run company, a ticket sales office. Over the years, I worked there for more than 10 years in total, with some breaks in between. This early experience gave me the opportunity to work as part of a team and eventually develop my leadership skills.</p>
        
        <p>Later, I started working for Turkish Airlines' handling company, TGS, which operates in a highly intense work environment. In my first position, all staff were required to make precise decisions. Our primary responsibility was to determine who could travel based on country regulations and passenger documentation. Considering Turkish Airlines has the largest network in the world, this role exposed me to a highly diverse passenger profile and unique challenges.</p>
        
        <p>I subsequently moved to a role in the same department's coordination unit, where I focused on detecting errors, conducting research, and extensively using MS Office tools for reporting and analysis.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I work in the Budget/Reporting and Business Development department. This position has helped me develop strong data analysis skills and provided me with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in designing the framework for programs during and before the development process.</p>
